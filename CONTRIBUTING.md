Getting started
Code of Conduct: Read and follow the project's Code of Conduct. We expect all contributors to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment.
No duplicates: Before opening an issue or pull request (PR), search the repository's issues to see if the topic already exists. Comment on an existing issue if you have additional information to add.
Discussion for major changes: For large or non-trivial changes, open an issue to discuss your proposal with the maintainers first. This ensures your work aligns with the project's direction and helps you avoid doing a lot of work for a change that may be rejected. 
Issues
Issues are used to track bugs, discuss features, and manage tasks.
Bug reports: Before submitting a bug report, confirm the issue exists in the latest version. Follow the provided issue template and include as much detail as possible, such as:
Steps to reproduce the problem
Stack traces, compiler errors, or screenshots
Your operating system and library versions
Feature requests: Explain why a feature would be useful to the project, not just to you. 
Pull requests (PRs)
This is the standard workflow for contributing code and documentation.
Fork the repository: Fork the project and clone your fork to your local machine.
Create a branch: Create a new, dedicated branch for your changes. Use a clear, descriptive name (e.g., fix/networking-issue, feat/new-api-endpoint).
Make changes:
Ensure your code is well-tested and includes sufficient unit tests.
Document your changes clearly with code comments.
Stick to the project's existing coding style and conventions. Consider using a linter if the project has one.
Update the CHANGELOG.md file for any enhancements or bug fixes.
Write clear commits:
Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
Limit the subject to 50 characters, capitalize it, and use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix broken link").
Use the body to explain the why of the change, not the what.
Open the PR:
Fill out the pull request template completely.
In the description, link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
Address review comments: Promptly respond to any comments or questions from reviewers.
Resolve merge conflicts: If conflicts occur, resolve them in your branch. 
Code review etiquette
Review the code, not the author: Maintain a respectful and professional tone. Provide constructive feedback that is actionable and explains your reasoning.
Accept criticism gracefully: Remember that feedback on your code is not a personal attack. Be open to suggestions and be willing to learn.
Assume good intentions: In written communication, assume others have good intentions, and be kind. 
Licensing
License agreement: By contributing to this project, you certify that your contribution is under the project's license.
